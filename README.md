# Computational Method Scripts
Scripts from advanced undergraduate or graduate level computational courses at the University of Toronto. Written for a mixture of projects, assignments, and experiments from numerous Physics and Statistical Sciences courses. My apologies to anyone trying to make sense of the sub modules â€” this was an ad hoc repository for collaboration and file transfer that will be sorted when I have time.

Where noted, certain required scripts were authored by Ilyas Sharif.
